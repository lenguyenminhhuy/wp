        <div>Who is your tutor / instructor</div>
        <div> Long Nguyen Minh is my tutor. He is very enthusiasm and responsible for providing us the web programming
          knowlegde. This is the first time I have studied with him. Hopefully we will have some great moments and
          achieve the best result as I expected.</div>

        <div>Who is your labber</div>
        <div> Teacher Long Nguyen Minh is still the one who guide me in doing lab tutorial. </div>

        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
        <div> In the previous semester, I had studied "Building IT systems" course of RMIT university.
          In some first days, I
          felt
          quite
          bored and unmotivated while coding my own website and fixing its bugs. However, the more I learned and
          practiced,
          the more
          interest of programming I
          received. I know pretty clearly about HTML, CSS and JS. On the other hand, I had lots of chances work with
          database such as MongoDB, etc. As a result, I gained lots of experiences in web programming, both front-end
          and back-end. </div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div>When I started coding some first websites. I have been confused about somethings that I should become a web
          designer or a web developer. In my opinion, being a web designer is creating many beautiful things for
          the Internet and using our creativity to make our websites look attractive and appealing. I realized that
          I am creative enough to become a web designer. I like every lovely thing and like making everything more
          beautiful. Besides that, a web developer is harder than a web designer. It requires us more academic knowledge
          and programming skills. Hence, during the study time at
          university, I am trying to gain more and more web programming knowledge to improve my coding skills and become
          an effective programmer. </div>

        <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
        <div> Before enrolling to this course, I have researched and learned myself about web programming to accomplish
          "Building IT
          system" course in which my team decided to build a timetabling website. Through that journey, I believe that I
          like coding a website more than I thought. This semester, therefore, I decided to take a chance to study this
          course to improve my web coding skills more and more. Furthermore, I want to create some usefull websites with
          some good features that help people a lot in their personal life. </div>

        <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
        <div> There will be several things that a student wants to receive from this course. After accomplishing this
          course, I need to be good at coding a website and host it successfully on the Internet. Besides, I
          believe that I can apply my web programming knowledge in both coding and designing to create an appealing
          website for the end-users.
        </div>

        <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you
          like your assignment partner to have?</div>
        <div> Recently, pair programming is one of the most effective software development techniques
          in which both programmers work together. Therefore, through the paired work, I can learn from them and improve
          my coding skills as well as teamwork skill. My strengths are flexibility, creativity and good at
          designing. That would help me
          design our website beautifully and attractively in an easy way.
          As regarding my partner, I would like them to have a responsibility while working as a team and a good web
          programming knowledge. Hopefully we will work well together and achieve the best result as much as possible.
        </div>

        <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
        <div> I divide into 2 types of websites which are websites for studying and websites for entertainment. As
          regarding
          studying some program languages through the Internet, I usually go to "W3Schools" and "CodeAcademy" sites.
          These
          places contain many free lessons about Technology and Science, which allow me to have oppoturnities in
          gathering
          the study material widely and easily. Besides, after a long time studying and working, I also need to relax
          and read news.
          "Facebook" and "Youtube" are two websites I use the most to find more fun and positive energy. </div>

        <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
        <div> Hobbies and some fun activities obviously help me to distract myself from the stress of life. They make me
          feel
          satisfied even when I was going through some disappointing things. There are several hobbies that I will do
          when I'm free such as listening to music, reading books and researching. Moreover, I often spend time
          finding some new things about programming as well as data science.
          I am
          interested in data, algorithms, and mathematics. And I believe that I can learn and understand deeply about
          machine learning and artificial intelligence as well. </div>
