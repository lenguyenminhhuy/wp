        <div>Who is your tutor / instructor</div>
        <div> Long Nguyen Minh is my tutor. He is very enthusiasm and responsible for providing us the web programming
          knowlegde.</div>

        <div>Who is your labber</div>
        <div></div>

        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
        <div>Yes I have. Well, I like to think so. In the previous semester, I studied "Building IT systems" course
          which helps me have lots of experiences in web programming, both front-end and back-end. At first, I felt
          quite
          bored while coding our website. However, the more I learned and practiced, the more interest of programming
          web I got. ...</div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div> When I started coding some first websites, I have been confused about somethings that I should become a
          web designer or a web developer. In my opinion, being a web designer is being created many beautiful things
          for the Internet and using our creativity to make our websites look attractive and appealing. And I realized
          that, I am creative enough to become a web designer. I like every lovely things and like making everything
          become more beautiful. Besides that, web developer is harder than web designer.
          Hence, during the study time at university, I still try to gain more and more web programming knowlegde to
          improve
          my coding skills and become an effective programmer. </div>

        <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
        <div> Before I study this course, I have researched and learned myself about web programming to accomplish
          "Building IT
          system" course in which my team decided to build a timebling website. Through that journey, I believe that I
          like coding a website more than I thought. This semester, therefore, I decide to take a chance to study this
          course to improve my web
          coding skills more and more. </div>

        <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
        <div> There will be several things that a student wants to receive from this course. After accomplishing this
          course, I need to be good at coding a website and host it successfully in the Internet. Besides, I
          believe that I can apply my web programming knowlegde in both coding and designing to create an appealing
          website for the end-users.
        </div>

        <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you
          like your assignment partner to have?</div>
        <div> My strengths are flexibility, creativity and good at designing. That would help me
          design our website beautifully in an easy way.
          As regarding to my partner, I would like them to have a responsiblity while working as a team and a good
          web programming knowledge. Recently, pair programming is one of the most effective software development
          techniques in which both
          programmers work together Therefore, through the paired work, I can learn from them and improve my coding
          skill as well as teamwork skill. </div>

        <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
        <div> I divide into 2 types of websites which are studying websites and entertaining website. Regarding to
          studying program languages through the Internet, I usually go to "W3Schools" and "CodeAcademy" websites. These
          places contains many free lessons about Technology and Science, which help me a lot in gathering the study
          material widely and easily. Besides, after a long time for learning, I also need to relax. "Facebook" and
          "Youtube" are two websites I use the most to find more fun and positive energy. </div>

        <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
        <div> There are several hobbies that I will do when I'm free such as listening to music, reading books and
          researching. Moreover, I spend most of time finding some new things about programming as well as data science.
          I am
          really interested in data, algorithm and mathematics. And I believe that I can learn and in-dept understanding
          about machine learning and artificial intelligence as well. </div>
